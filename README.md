# General

### What is StablePay?

StablePay is a decentralized payment platform that enables users to make payments with Ethereum or others ERC20 tokens, that get instantly converted to DAI token.

### How StablePay works?

The contracts function as gateway for receiving token payments, seek the best rate for trading on existing decentralized exchanges\(Uniswap, Kyber\), and swap the tokens to DAI token, to finally send them over to the receiver.
