# Smart URLs

You can build and share a link for payments or donations via message\(chat, twitter, email\). with the StablePay's Smart URLs. You can easily paste the links into your content, like newsletters, podcasts, youtube channel. You configure the URL to fit your preference in payments.

The Smart URLs follow this simple easy to understand syntax:

[https://payd.ai/](https://payd.ai/me/10/DAI/to/0xb6568dc090302196EC8EDf56D99C3484cEe94E6a)me/{amount}/{token/action}/to/{ethreum address}

## Example

amount = 1

token = DAI

address = 0x830bAF0080766a88Ff70F124f5016efD4Af9c025

## [https://payd.ai/me/1/DAI/to/](https://payd.ai/me/10/DAI/to/0xb6568dc090302196EC8EDf56D99C3484cEe94E6a)0x830bAF0080766a88Ff70F124f5016efD4Af9c025

## Example 2\(send to Compound\)

amount = 1

action = dai2compound

address = 0x830bAF0080766a88Ff70F124f5016efD4Af9c025

## [https://payd.ai/me/1/dai2compound/to/](https://payd.ai/me/10/DAI/to/0xb6568dc090302196EC8EDf56D99C3484cEe94E6a)0x830bAF0080766a88Ff70F124f5016efD4Af9c025

**Note:** Donations and payments directly from the same token \(e.g DAI to DAI\) are free of fees to receive, and sender will only incur the gas costs of the transaction like any normal ethereum transaction. In the case of a token conversion it will incur in a small platform fee that will be deducted from the final amount.
