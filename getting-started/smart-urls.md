# Smart URLs

You can send a link for payments or donations via message\(chat, twitter, email\). with the Smart URL.

The URL is building with the following syntax:

[https://payd.ai/](https://payd.ai/me/10/DAI/to/0xb6568dc090302196EC8EDf56D99C3484cEe94E6a)me/{amount}/{token/action}/to/{ethreum address}

#### Example

amount = 1

token = DAI

address = 0x830bAF0080766a88Ff70F124f5016efD4Af9c025

#### [https://payd.ai/me/1/DAI/to/](https://payd.ai/me/10/DAI/to/0xb6568dc090302196EC8EDf56D99C3484cEe94E6a)0x830bAF0080766a88Ff70F124f5016efD4Af9c025

#### Example 2\(send to Compound\)

amount = 1

action = dai2compound

address = 0x830bAF0080766a88Ff70F124f5016efD4Af9c025

#### [https://payd.ai/me/1/dai2compound/to/](https://payd.ai/me/10/DAI/to/0xb6568dc090302196EC8EDf56D99C3484cEe94E6a)0x830bAF0080766a88Ff70F124f5016efD4Af9c025

**Note:** Donations and payments directly from DAI to DAI are free of fees to receive, will only incur the gas costs of the transaction.. Any other token will be converted and a small fee will be charge before receiving the final amount. Read more here: [https://stablepay.io/faqs](https://stablepay.io/faqs).
